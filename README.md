   ROBOTC default Platform Type is Vex IQ, but it should be Vex 2.0 Cortex.

   Change it in `Robot > Platform Type > Vex Robotics > Vex 2.0 Cortex`

## Troubleshooting
>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you encounter any issue that is not listed in the troubleshooting section, contact me at ethan.thanh@sjsu.edu so I can hopefully find a solution other than get a new XYZ part.


To effectively figure out wbat is wrong with the robot, we must use debugging windows. To access these windows,

1. Download code to robot.
2. Go to `Robot > Debugger Windows` and make sure the following are selected from the menu: `Motors, Sensors, Variables`

>[!NOTE]
>Debugging windows will only display values when the robot is plugged in.

The following sections are symptoms with their respective resolutions.

### Debug window indicates change in motor/sensor/variable value, but no change is observed


    
### Robot LED is not on

 

### Robot LED irradically flashes between red and green



### Controller LEDs are flashing orange
